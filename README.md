# Simon-Game ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¥  ðŸŸ¨  ðŸŸ¦  

This is my take on the classic Simon Game. Test your memory by remembering the sequence in which the buttons light up. Careful the pattern does not restart (repeat itself) so you have to remember every step from beginning to end.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later
- npm (comes bundled with Node)

### Web Technology Stack
HTML, CSS, Javascript

### Test Your Skills

- The interface features four colored buttons with sound effects. See `simon-game-preview.png` for a screenshot.

### Running Tests

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` to download the development dependencies defined in `package.json` (such as Jest).
2. Run `npm test` to execute the Jest test suite located in the `tests/` directory.
